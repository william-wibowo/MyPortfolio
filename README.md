## Payment Matching - ID NDSC 2020
This is a Payment Matching case that was contested a few months ago at NDSC(National Data Science Competition) 2020. In this competition, I used fuzzywuzzy packages helps to gain the levenshtein score from the buyer name & description. Based on the levenshtein score, I can finally have some clue about which customer do which transaction. At the end, I submited a late submission and succesfully got a 0.9944 Public Score & 0.99433 Private Score. Here's [the link](https://www.kaggle.com/lgamal/payment-matching/) to my kaggle notebook.

## Market Basket - ID NDSC 2020
On the previous NDSC(National Data Science Competition) 2020 event, there's a market basket analysis case. I grouped orderid based on customerid to make the matching process more easier. At the end, I submited a late submission and succesfully got a 1.0 Public Score & 1.0 Private Score. Here's [the link](https://www.kaggle.com/lgamal/market-basket) to my kaggle notebook.
